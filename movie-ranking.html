<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>INTESTELLAR</h3>
<p>It is a mind gripping movie that makes you think in ways you've never thought. It forecasts on relativity and space-time complexity.</p>
<h3>The MISSION IMPOSSIBLE FRANCHISE</h3>
<p>A stellar spy-action-thriller that guarantees an engaging ride</p>
<h3>The TERMINAL</h3>
<p>A soft hearted mood lightning movie which brings out the emotions in you.</p>
